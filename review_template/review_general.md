# Automatic Extraction of Study Representation: @@@PAPER_TITLE@@@
*@@@AUTHORS@@@*


You will be presented with the output of an LLM which was tasked to extract a representation of your study based on your paper, including research questions, hypotheses, the experiment used to test the hypothesis, the interpretation of the outcome of the experiment and your conclusions.

We ask you to **open your PDF** that was presented to the LLM, to reflect upon the LLM's answer with your paper.

The answer of the LLM is structured into three parts; Hypothesis, experiments and interpretation (of experiment outcome).
- For each experiment the LLM has linked it to one or more hypothesis
- For each interpretation, the LLM has linked it to **one** experiment and **one** hypothesis.

A few notes:
- Research questions are seen as motiviations for the study; they are framed as questions but are often encountered problems as well in the field of computational science.
- The LLM has been tasked to extract a hypothesis **including an expected outcome**. Some studies may have new hypotheses developed during the study instead of before; it should be interpreted as a post-hoc hypothesis.
- The LLM is also tasked to connect the figures, tables and textual results to your experiments. It needs to be verified that these links make sense with its representation.

Please answer the questions in the  following sections.

## Research Questions

@@@RESEARCH_QUESTION_SECTIONS@@@

### General Research Questions questions

The LLM has provided you with one or more research questions from your work. Is this the amount of research questions the same as the amount you specified or implied?

Please write the amount of research questions you had for the study: []

If this amount does not overlap with the LLMs answer, feel free to specify reasons below;


## Hypotheses

@@@HYPOTHESIS_SECTIONS@@@

### General Hypothesis questions

The LLM has provided you with zero or more hypothesis from your work. Is this the amount of hypothesis the same as the amount you specified?

Please write the amount of hypothesis you had for the study: []

If this amount does not overlap with the LLMs answer, feel free to specify reasons below;


## Experiments

The LLM has found one or more experiment that were used for the empirical evaluation of your research questions or hypotheses. 

In each subsection one of the experiments is listed, with key details that describe it.
For each detail, please correct the LLM if necessary;
- You can leave the correction field empty if no corrections are necessary.
- If any changes are required:
    - [!] Copy the output of the LLM into your answer field
    - If an element is partially incorrect, update it there
    - If an element is wrong, remove it from the list
    - If an element is missing, add it at the end

@@@EXPERIMENT_SECTIONS@@@

### General Experiment Questions

The LLM has provided you with one or more experiments from your work. Is this amount of experiments the same as the amount you specified?

Please write the amount of experiments you had for the study: []

If this amount does not overlap with the LLMs answer, feel free to specify reasons below;

@@@ANALYSIS_SECTIONS@@@

### General Analysis Questions

The LLM has provided you with one or more analyses from your work. Is this amount of analyses the same as the amount you specified?

Please write the amount of analyses you had for the study: []

If this amount does not overlap with the LLMs answer, feel free to specify reasons below;


## Interpretation

Experiment outcomes are analysed and interpreted to determine whether the experiment supports the hypothesis or not. 

The LLM has found the following interpretations of the experiment outcomes;

@@@INTERPRETATION_SECTIONS@@@

### General Interpretation Questions

The LLM has provided you with one or more interpretations from your work. Is this amount of interpretations the same as the amount you specified?

Please write the amount of interpretations you had for the study: []

If this amount does not overlap with the LLMs answer, feel free to specify reasons below;

## Conclusions

The interpretations are used to draw conclusions, which either reflect upon the previous research questions or hypotheses, or yield new research questions or hypotheses.

The LLM has found the following conclusions on the interpretations;

Please write the amount of conclusions you had for the study: []

If this amount does not overlap with the LLMs answer, feel free to specify reasons below;


## Future Work

The LLM has also found possible future work directions in terms of research questions or hypotheses yielded from an exploratory angle of your study.
